# StickHero
In this project, we developed a game where a character named stick-hero traverses between platforms by stretching out a stick.

Game Mechanics:

The player can control the stickman character using the arrow keys. To stretch out the stick, the player can press <key_to_stretch_stick>. To release the stick, the player can press <key_to_release_stick>. To flip the stickman upside down, the player can press <key_to_flip_stickman>. To collect cherries, the player must flip the stickman upside down while it is in the air. If the stickman falls into the abyss, the game is over.

Reviving Feature:

The player can be revived once using a certain amount of cherries. To revive the stickman, the player must press <key_to_revive_stickman>. After the player has been revived, the cherries (and related score) will be deducted.

Scoring System:

The player earns points for collecting cherries. The more cherries the player collects, the higher their score will be. Restarting, Saving, and Loading:

To restart the current level, the player can press <key_to_restart_level>. To save the player's progress, the player can press <key_to_save_progress>. To load a previously saved game, the player can press <key_to_load_saved_game>.
